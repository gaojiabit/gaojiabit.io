#What is grammar?

Grammar is the way we arrange words to make proper sentences.Word-level grammar covers verbs and tense,nouns,adverbs etc.
Sentence-level grammar covers phrases,clauses,reported speech etc.
语法是我们合理的创建语句的规则。单词级别的语法包括动词和时态，名词，副词等。语句级别的语法主要是短语，从句，引用等。
Grammar is the system of a language. 
People sometimes describe grammar as the "rules" of a language; but in fact no language has rules. 
If we use the word "rules", we suggest that somebody created the rules first and then spoke the language, like a new game. 
But languages did not start like that.
Languages started by people making sounds which evolved(进化演变) into words, phrases（短语，词组，惯用表达） and sentences.
No commonly-spoken language is fixed. 没有一种通用语言是固定的 All languages change over time.所有语言都会随着时间而改变
What we call "grammar"  is  simply a reflection of a language at a particular time.我们所说的“语法”只是特定时期语言的反映
Do we need to study grammar to learn a language? The short answer is "no".
Very many people in the world speak their own, native language without having studied its grammar. 
Children start to speak before they even know the word "grammar".孩子开始说话的时候甚至不知道“语法”这个词
But if you are serious about learning a foreign language, the long answer is "yes, 
grammar can help you to learn a language more quickly and more efficiently."
如果你学习你们外语，答案是肯定的，语法可以帮助你更快和更有效的学习一门语言
It's important to think of grammar as something that can help you, like a friend.
When you understand the grammar (or system) of a language, you can understand many things yourself, 
without having to ask a teacher or look in a book.

So think of grammar as something good, something positive,
something that you can use to find your way - like a signpost or a map. 语法像一个路标或者地图
