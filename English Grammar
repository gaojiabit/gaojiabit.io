#What is grammar?

Grammar is the way we arrange words to make proper sentences.Word-level grammar covers verbs and tense,nouns,adverbs etc.
Sentence-level grammar covers phrases,clauses,reported speech etc.
语法是我们合理的创建语句的规则。单词级别的语法包括动词和时态，名词，副词等。语句级别的语法主要是短语，从句，引用等。
Grammar is the system of a language. 
People sometimes describe grammar as the "rules" of a language; but in fact no language has rules. 
If we use the word "rules", we suggest that somebody created the rules first and then spoke the language, like a new game. 
But languages did not start like that.
Languages started by people making sounds which evolved(进化演变) into words, phrases（短语，词组，惯用表达） and sentences.
No commonly-spoken language is fixed. 没有一种通用语言是固定的 All languages change over time.所有语言都会随着时间而改变
What we call "grammar"  is  simply a reflection of a language at a particular time.我们所说的“语法”只是特定时期语言的反映
Do we need to study grammar to learn a language? The short answer is "no".
Very many people in the world speak their own, native language without having studied its grammar. 
Children start to speak before they even know the word "grammar".孩子开始说话的时候甚至不知道“语法”这个词
But if you are serious about learning a foreign language, the long answer is "yes, 
grammar can help you to learn a language more quickly and more efficiently."
如果你学习你们外语，答案是肯定的，语法可以帮助你更快和更有效的学习一门语言
It's important to think of grammar as something that can help you, like a friend.
When you understand the grammar (or system) of a language, you can understand many things yourself, 
without having to ask a teacher or look in a book.
So think of grammar as something good, something positive,
something that you can use to find your way - like a signpost or a map. 语法像一个路标或者地图

Here are 20 simple rules and tips to help you avoid mistakes in English grammar.

1. A sentence starts with a capital letter and ends with a period/full stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark.一个句子大写开头句号，问号，感叹号结尾。
  The fat cat sat on the mat.
  Where do you live?
  My dog is very clever!
2. The order of a basic positive sentence is Subject-Verb-Object. (Negative and question sentences may have a different order.)
一个肯定句的基本顺序是 主语 + 谓语 + 宾语，否定句和疑问顺序可能不同
  John loves Mary.
  They were driving their car to Bangkok.
3. Every sentence must have a subject and a verb. 一个语句必须有一个主语和一个谓语
An object is optional. 宾语是可选的
Note that an imperative sentence may have a verb only, but the subject is understood.
  John teaches.
  John teaches English.
  Stop! (i.e. You stop!)
4. The subject and verb must agree in number, that is a singular subject needs a singular verb and a plural subject needs a plural verb.
  主语和动词数必须一致，单数主语使用单数动词，多数主语使用多数动词
  John works in London. 乔恩在伦敦工作
  That monk eats once a day.和尚一天吃一顿饭
  John and Mary work in London.乔恩和马丽在伦敦上班
  Most people eat three meals a day.大多数人一天吃三餐
5. When two singular subjects are connected by or, use a singular verb. The same is true for either/or and neither/nor.
  当两个单数主语用 or 连接时，用单数动词。 either/or 和neither/nor 也一样。
  John or Mary is coming tonight.
  Either coffee or tea is fine.
  Neither John nor Mary was late.
6. Adjectives usually come before a noun (except when a verb separates the adjective from the noun).
  形容词通常位于名词之前（除非动词将形容词与名词分开）。
  I have a big dog.
  She married a handsome Italian man.
  (Her husband is rich.)
7. When using two or more adjectives together, the usual order is opinion-adjective + fact-adjective + noun. (There are some additional rules for the order of fact adjectives.)
    当两个或多个形容词一起使用时，通常的顺序是观点形容词 + 事实形容词 + 名词。（事实形容词的顺序还有一些额外的规则。）
  越严格的越靠后
  I saw a nice French table.
  That was an interesting Shakespearian play.
8. Treat collective nouns (e.g. committee, company, board of directors) as singular OR plural. 集体名词的单数和复数
  In BrE a collective noun is usually treated as plural, needing a plural verb and pronoun.  英国当做复数
  In AmE a collective noun is often treated as singular, needing a singular verb and pronoun. 美国当做单数
  
  The committee are having sandwiches for lunch. Then they will go to London. (typically BrE)
  The BBC have changed their logo. (typically BrE)
  My family likes going to the zoo. (typically AmE)
  CNN has changed its logo. (typically AmE)
9. The words its and it's are two different words with different meanings. its和it's是不同的词
  The dog has hurt its leg.
  He says it's two o'clock.
10. The words your and you're are two different words with different meanings.
  Here is your coffee.
  You're looking good.
11. The words there, their and they're are three different words with different meanings.

  There was nobody at the party.
  I saw their new car.
  Do you think they're happy?
12. The contraction he's can mean he is OR he has. Similarly, she's can mean she is OR she has, and it's can mean it is OR it has, and John's can mean John is OR John has.

  He is working
  He has finished.
  She is here.
  She has left.
  John is married.
  John has divorced his wife.
13. The contraction he'd can mean he had OR he would. Similarly, they'd can mean they had OR they would.
  He had eaten when I arrived.
  He would eat more if possible.
  They had already finished.
  They would come if they could.
14. Spell a proper noun with an initial capital letter. A proper noun is a "name" of something, for example Josef, Mary, Russia, China, British Broadcasting Corporation, English.
  专有名词要大写
  We have written to Mary.
  Is China in Asia?
  Do you speak English?
15. Spell proper adjectives with an initial capital letter. Proper adjectives are made from proper nouns, for example Germany → German, Orwell → Orwellian, Machiavelli → Machiavellian.
  专有形容词要大写
  London is an English town.
  Who is the Canadian prime minister?
  Which is your favourite Shakespearian play?
16. Use the indefinite article a/an for countable nouns in general. Use the definite article the for specific countable nouns and all uncountable nouns.
一般可数名词用不定冠词 a/an，特定可数名词和所有不可数名词用定冠词 the。
  I saw a bird and a balloon in the sky. 一般可数名词用a/an
  The bird was blue and the balloon was yellow. 特定可数名词用the
  He always saves some of the money that he earns. 不可数名词用the
17. Use the indefinite article a with words beginning with a consonant sound. Use the indefinite article an with words beginning with a vowel sound. see When to Say a or an
  在以辅音开头的单词中使用不定冠词 a。在以元音开头的单词中使用不定冠词 an。
  a cat, a game of golf, a human endeavour, a Frenchman, a university (you-ni-ver-si-ty)
  an apple, an easy job, an interesting story, an old man, an umbrella, an honorable man (on-o-ra-ble)
18. Use many or few with countable nouns. Use much/a lot or little for uncountable nouns. see Quantifiers
对可数名词使用 many 或 few。对不可数名词使用 much/a lot 或 little。参见量词
  How many dollars do you have? 可数名词many
  How much money do you have?  不可数名词用much
  There are a few cars outside.  可数名词few
  There is little traffic on the roads.
19. To show possession (who is the owner of something) use an apostrophe + s for singular owners, and s + apostrophe for plural owners.
  要表示所有权（谁是某物的所有者），使用撇号 + s 表示单数所有者，使用 s + 撇号表示复数所有者。
  The boy's dog. (one boy)
  The boys' dog. (two or more boys)
20. In general, use the active voice (Cats eat fish) in preference to the passive voice (Fish are eaten by cats).
  一般来说，使用主动语态（猫吃鱼），而不是被动语态（鱼被猫吃）。
  We use active in preference to passive. 肯定句优先使用主动语态
  Active is used in preference to passive.肯定句优先使用主动语态
